					<h3><b>Company Overview<b></h3>
					<p class="text-justify">Twitter is an online news and social networking service where users post and interact with messages, known as "tweets." These messages were originally restricted to 140 characters, but on November 7, 2017, the limit was doubled to 280 characters for all languages except Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.[11] Registered users can post tweets, but those who are unregistered can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface, Short Message Service (SMS) or mobile device application software ("app").[12] Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[13]
					Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams and launched in July of that year. The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity. In 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day,[14] and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[15][16][17] In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet".[18][19] As of 2016, Twitter had more than 319 million monthly active users.[9] On the day of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter proved to be the largest source of breaking news, with 40 million election-related tweets sent by 10 p.m. (Eastern Time) that day.[20] </p>
